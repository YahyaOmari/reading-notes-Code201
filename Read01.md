# HTML and CSS

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create the actual content of the page, 
such as written text, and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) is responsible 
for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects 
and background color.

1. HTML

- You will see
that you start by writing down
the words you want to appear
on your page. You then add tags
or elements to the words so
that the browser knows what is
a heading, where a paragraph
begins and ends, and so on.

2. CSS

- We start this section with a
chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages. We then go on to
look at the wide variety of CSS
properties you can use in your
CSS rules. These properties
generally fall into one of two
categories:

How people access the Web ..

### Devices
- People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. It is important to
remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.

### Browsers
- People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
In order to view a web page,
users might type a web address
into their browser, follow a
link from another site, or use a
bookmark.

### Web Servers
- When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.
Web servers are special
computers that are constantly
connected to the Internet, and
are optimized to send web pages
out to people who request them.

#### How the Web Works
- When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

HTML and CSS use elements to describe the structure and design of the page.
Example :

#### We can use Forms in HTML..

- The "form" element uses the action attribute to indicate the page that
the data is being sent to. Each of the form controls sits inside the "form"
element. Different types of form control are suited to collecting different
types of data. The "fieldset" element is used to group related
questions together. The "label" element indicates the purpose of each
form control.

- Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
"form" element.


# JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. ... Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the *HTML* of a webpage


#### Examples of JavaSript in the brwoser..

- Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in
the browser is very powerful. 

The examples below rely on the ability to:
- Access the content of the page.
- Modify the content of the page.
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
- React to events triggered by the user or browser.


#### How a browser sees a WebPage

*In order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML
page using JavaScript, you need to know how a browser interprets the
HTML code and applies styling to it.*

1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE

- Each page on a website can be
seen as a separate document .
So, the web consists of many
sites, each made up of one or
more documents. 

2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY

- The model shown on the right
hand page is a representation
of one very basic page. Its
structure is reminiscent of a
family tree. At the top of the
model is a document object,
which represents the whole
document. 

3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN

- If there is no CSS, the rendering
engine will apply default styles
to HTML elements. However,
the HTML code for this example
links to a CSS style sheet, so the
browser requests that file and
displays the page accordingly.
