## CSS Layout

Website Layout
A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer.
### Header
A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). It often contains a logo or the website name.

.header {
 
  background-color: #F1F1F1;
 
  text-align: center;
 
  padding: 20px;

}

### Navigation Bar
A navigation bar contains a list of links to help visitors navigating through your website.

### Footer
The footer is placed at the bottom of your page. It often contains information like copyright and contact info.

.footer {
 
  background-color: #F1F1F1;
 
  text-align: center;
 
  padding: 10px;

}
