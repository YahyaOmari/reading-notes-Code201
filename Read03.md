All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 

Explanation of the different parts:

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.
> The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

## This is how it works:

1. The switch expression is evaluated once.
2. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
3. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
4. If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
