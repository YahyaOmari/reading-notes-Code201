## Error Handling & Debugging


Debugging: A process for testing, finding the errors and reducing them from happening in future. Debugging JavaScript either requires having support for JavaScript debugger keyword, breakpoint support with web browser tools, or third-party tools. 

### Code Debugging
Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.

Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.

Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.

Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

### JavaScript Debuggers
Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.

Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.

With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.
