### Images

We can improve the design using images.

We can change the width and height of the image.

The "img" tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The "img" tag has two required attributes:
- src - Specifies the path to the image.
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image.

The src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view the image. Like if the user did not find the image it will display the value of the alt attribute.
